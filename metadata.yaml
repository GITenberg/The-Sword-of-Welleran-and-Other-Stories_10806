description: "The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories is the third book by Irish fantasy\
  \ writer Lord Dunsany, considered a major influence on the work of J. R. R. Tolkien,\
  \ H. P. Lovecraft, Ursula K. Le Guin and others. It was first published in hardcover\
  \ by George Allen & Sons in October, 1908, and has been reprinted a number of times\
  \ since. Issued by the Modern Library in a combined edition with A Dreamer's Tales\
  \ as A Dreamer's Tales and Other Stories in 1917.\nThe book is a series of short\
  \ stories, some of them linked by Dunsany's invented pantheon of deities who dwell\
  \ in Pegāna, which were the focus of his earlier collections The Gods of Pegāna\
  \ and Time and the Gods. One of the stories, \"The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save\
  \ for Sacnoth,\" was afterwards (1910) published by itself as a separate book, a\
  \ now very-rare \"Art-and-Craft\" style limited edition.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC\
